Hi Esther,

- First impression
The first impression on your resume looks **professional** with clear sections. Also, I really like your career summary included, so the reader immediately knows your value proposition, especially the technique and skill you learned from each job. The resume's length and overall appearance are appropriate, but if you can include the *result* in summary might help the reader to see what you've contributed to your work.

- Resume sections
Each resume section is clearly labeled and work history listed nicely, but I noticed that you could list them in reverse chronological order (most recent job first).

- Accomplishments
You have done a really great job of including a solid listing of your career accomplishments on your resume. Also, these accomplishments are quantified by using numbers or other concrete measures of success that make the resume clearer.

Overall, I think you did such a good job on this resume! I hope this guide has been helpful to you, and I hope you are successful in finding a great job. May you become a receiver of all the success in life:)
Ella
